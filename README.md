# Devops-Copilot
“DevOps Copilot” 🚀

> 🔧 **Just Deployed My Full-Stack DevOps Project – DevOps Copilot!** 🌐
>
> Proud to share **DevOps Copilot**, a tool I built to simplify and automate DevOps workflows using AI and cloud-native technologies:
>
> ✅ Built with **JavaScript** (backend), **HTML/CSS** (frontend)
> ✅ Used **n8n** to integrate AI (Google Gemini Chat mode) for command generation
> ✅ Implemented **IAM policy automation** and validated AWS permissions 🔐
> ✅ Hosted on **AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)** and containerized with **Docker** 🐳
> ✅ Managed code versioning with **Git and GitHub**
>
> I even handled real-world errors like IAM policy validation issues (as shown below ⬇️), enhancing the project with proper role-based access control.
>
> 🧠 Goal: To build an **AI-powered DevOps assistant** that can understand prompts, generate scripts, and execute tasks — intelligently and securely.
